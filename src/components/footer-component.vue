          <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
            My interest in games began at an early age with titles like Mario and later expanded through PC games such as GTA Vice City.

I started developing games in 2019, creating early prototypes alongside programming courses. After graduating from an associate degree program in Turkey with a completed game project, I continued my studies in Finland to further develop my skills in game production. Over the years, I have worked on and published games across PC and mobile platforms, participated in small team projects during the pandemic, and later in 2025 co-founded a small company in Finland where we released a game on Steam. Toward the end of the same year, I also collaborated with another team to publish a Steam demo.

Outside of development: I enjoy game jams, exploring new games with friends, and working on experimental projects.
